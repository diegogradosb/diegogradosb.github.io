As part of my Marie Skłodowska‐Curie Fellowship, I hold a dual position as a [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/diego-grados/) in USA and an [Assistant Professor](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/diego-grados-bedoya(3440613a-7e18-4bb9-b0ee-4f8a5b5a29af).html) in Denmark. Prior to this, I enjoyed *[hygge](https://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/highlights/hygge/what-hygge)* while carrying out my research activities as a [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://agro.au.dk/en/research/research-sections/climate-and-water) in Denmark. My academic journey began as a nomadic [PhD Researcher](https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/biosyst/mebios), during which I conducted research in Peru and Belgium. The current goal of my research is to understand better how we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change for agroecosystems, without compromising food security. My approach involves creating and using data-driven applications, experimental data, and process-based models at diverse spatiotemporal scales. I have a strong preference for open-source software, and I am an avid hiker. In my spare time, I attempt to play the [harmonica](https://www.hohner.de/en/instruments/harmonicas/diatonic/progressive/special-20) ~~and [piano](https://www.achamilton.co.uk/old/HP3e.htm). Drone pilot and fervent maker of the world-famous [Pisco Sour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisco_sour)~~. I also enjoy landscape photography and support &nbsp;&nbsp;[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diegogradosb/diegogradosb.github.io/master/img/scientist_rebellion/scientistrebellion_logo.png)](https://scientistrebellion.com/).

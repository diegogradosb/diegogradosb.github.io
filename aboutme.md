I was a nomadic [PhD Researcher](https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/biosyst/mebios) spending my investigation time in Peru and Belgium. Now, I am *[hygging](https://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/highlights/hygge/what-hygge)* around Denmark while fulfilling my activities as [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/diego-grados-bedoya(3440613a-7e18-4bb9-b0ee-4f8a5b5a29af).html). The motivation of my current research is to assess mitigation strategies for greenhouse gas emissions of agroecosystems using data-processing applications and process-based simulation modeling. I am an—as much as possible—user of open-source software and avid traveller attempting to play the [harmonica](https://www.hohner.de/en/instruments/harmonicas/diatonic/progressive/special-20) and [piano](https://www.achamilton.co.uk/old/HP3e.htm). ~~Drone pilot and fervent maker of the world famous [Pisco Sour](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/travel/enjoying-pisco-cocktails-in-lima-peru.html)~~. Sporadic landscape photographer with very particular skills for cooking.

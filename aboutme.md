I was a nomadic [PhD Researcher](https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/biosyst/mebios) spending my investigation time in Peru and Belgium. Currently, I am *[hygging](https://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/highlights/hygge/what-hygge)* around Denmark while fulfilling my activities as [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/diego-grados-bedoya(3440613a-7e18-4bb9-b0ee-4f8a5b5a29af).html). The goal of my research is to better understand how we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change for agroecosystems, without compromising food security. My approach involves using data-driven applications, experimental data, and process-based modeling. I have a strong preference for open-source software and I am an avid traveler. In my spare time, I attempt to play the [harmonica](https://www.hohner.de/en/instruments/harmonicas/diatonic/progressive/special-20) ~~and [piano](https://www.achamilton.co.uk/old/HP3e.htm). Drone pilot and fervent maker of the world-famous [Pisco Sour](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/travel/enjoying-pisco-cocktails-in-lima-peru.html)~~. I also enjoy landscape photography and support &nbsp;&nbsp;[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diegogradosb/diegogradosb.github.io/master/img/scientist_rebellion/scientistrebellion_logo.png)](https://scientistrebellion.com/).

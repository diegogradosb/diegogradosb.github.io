As part of my Marie Skłodowska‐Curie Fellowship, I hold a dual position as [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/diego-grados/) in the USA and [Assistant Professor](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/diego-grados-bedoya(3440613a-7e18-4bb9-b0ee-4f8a5b5a29af).html) (non-tenure track) in Denmark. Before this, I enjoyed *[hygge](https://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/highlights/hygge/what-hygge)* while carrying out my research activities as a [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://agro.au.dk/en/research/research-sections/climate-and-water) in Denmark. My academic journey began as a nomadic [PhD Researcher](https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/biosyst/mebios), during which I conducted research in Belgium and Peru. My current research goal is to better understand how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change for agroecosystems without compromising food security. My approach involves experimental data, statistics, data-driven applications, and process-based models at diverse spatiotemporal scales. I have a strong preference for open-source software, and I am an avid hiker. In my spare time, I attempt to play the [harmonica](https://www.hohner.de/en/instruments/harmonicas/diatonic/progressive/special-20) ~~and [piano](https://www.achamilton.co.uk/old/HP3e.htm). Drone pilot and fervent maker of the world-famous [Pisco Sour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisco_sour)~~. I also enjoy landscape photography.
